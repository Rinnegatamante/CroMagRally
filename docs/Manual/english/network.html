			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Cro-Mag Rally can be played over a Local Area Network (LAN) with 2 to 6 players.  The game uses Net Sprocket for configuring the network game, so you may already be familiar with the interface from other games.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To start a Network game one person has to be the Host and all other players are Client who join the game which is created by the Host.  The Host is responsible for selecting the play mode and the track which will be played.  For the best performance, it is recommended that the Host be whichever player is on the fastest computer.  Clients can leave a network game and the game will continue to play without them, however, if the Host leaves the network game then the game is terminated.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Net Sprocket allows you to play over an AppleTalk or TCP/IP connection.  We do not recommend playing over TCP/IP since the game will run extremely slowly, but should you care to try it the option is there.  The &quot;Play on this machine&quot; option must be set.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When you press OK, the game will be established on the network, and other players may now join the game...</font></p>

Newer versions of the game may not be compatible with older versions, so make sure that all players have the same version.</font></p>
